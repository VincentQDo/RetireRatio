# üìò RetireRatio: MVP Project Proposal

## üß† Concept Summary

**RetireRatio** is a data-driven financial dashboard that visualizes long-term macroeconomic trends ‚Äî especially **retirement-related capital flows** and **demographic pressures** ‚Äî to help investors understand structural market risk and opportunity.

The core focus is on:
- **401(k) and IRA contribution vs. withdrawal behavior**
- **Aging U.S. population and its impact on retirement liquidity**
- **Passive vs. active investing trends**
- **Macro insights backed by real public data**

This project is for long-term thinkers and data-driven investors, not real-time traders.
